# Clothing Type Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

### Problem and Data Set
This project, part of the Machine Learning course in the BSc Data Science program at the IT University of Copenhagen, focuses on exploring various methods for determining the type of clothing from grayscale images. The dataset comprises 15,000 labeled images of clothing items, categorized into five types: T-shirt/top, Trousers, Pullover, Dress, and Shirt.

## Scientific Requirements

### Visualisation and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Provide scatterplots of data projected onto the first two principal components and linear discriminant variables.
- Interpret the first few principal components in terms of image transformation.

### Classification
- Implement LDA as a reduction technique from scratch
- Implement a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch.
- Explore kNN and Decision Trees


### Report
- Submit a 15-page report, including visualizations, technical details, and interpretations.
- Detail the application of each classification method and the implementation of LDA and Naive Bayes.
- Discuss and interpret the results, comparing the performance of different methods.
